## How to use:
Compile or download from release. Start the TwitchGrobs.exe

After you start it you will be warned that Google Chrome is going to be closed.

Next bot gonna check the streamers that are online, and then you can choose the ones that you want to exclude, incase you already watched them or something

Then just leave your PC or have chrome window running on background. Bot auto-claims drops once they hit 100% and switches to another streamer.
